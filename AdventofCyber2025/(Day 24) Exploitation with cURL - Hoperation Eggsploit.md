- cURL -> you can send GET / POST requests; Control headers (User-Agent); Handle cookies/sessions; Automate attacks (bruteforce) -> basically hacking using the terminal
- brute force -> repeated POST requests
  
### Commands:
- `curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://MACHINE_IP/post.php` : stimulates a login form
- `curl -c cookies.txt -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://MACHINE_IP/cookie.php` : save cookie
- `curl -b cookies.txt http://MACHINE_IP/cookie.php` : reuse cookie

## Answers: 
- Make a POST request to the /post.php endpoint with the username admin and the password admin. What is the flag you receive? : `THM{curl_post_success}`
- Make a request to the /cookie.php endpoint with the username admin and the password admin and save the cookie. Reuse that saved cookie at the same endpoint. What is the flag your receive? : `THM{session_cookie_master}`
- After doing the brute force on the /bruteforce.php endpoint, what is the password of the admin user? : `secretpass`
- Make a request to the /agent.php endpoint with the user-agent TBFC. What is the flag your receive? : `THM{user_agent_filter_bypassed}`
