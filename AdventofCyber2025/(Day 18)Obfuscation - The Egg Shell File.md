- Obfuscation -> makes data hard to read or analyze; allows attackers to evade detection, delay analysis, Bypass simple keyword-based security tools
- Basic Obfuscation Techniques (Use cyberChef to decode)
     1. ROT Ciphers: ROT1: Shifts each letter forward by 1; ROT13: Shifts letters by 13
     2. XOR Obfuscation: Each byte is XOR’ed with a key
