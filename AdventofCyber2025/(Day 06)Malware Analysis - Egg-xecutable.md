- Static analysis: analysis without running/executing the sample; quicker and safer 
- Dynamic analysis: analysis by running the sample; uses a sandbox environment to carry out safely
- Sandbox environment: used to execute potentially dangerous code
- Use of static analysis-

- File hashes: a unique signature for a file
- Regshot: captures snapshots of the Windows registry before and after the sample is run and then compares the difference
- Malware persistence
- Malware may use:
      Obfuscation/Packing to hide code; 
      Anti-analysis tricks to avoid detection

## Answers: 
- Static analysis: What is the SHA256Sum of the HopHelper.exe? : `F29C270068F865EF4A747E2683BFA07667BF64E768B38FBB9A2750A3D879CA33`
- Static analysis: Within the strings of HopHelper.exe, a flag with the format THM{XXXXX} exists. What is that flag value? : `THM{STRINGS_FOUND}`
- Dynamic analysis: What registry value has the HopHelper.exe modified for persistence? : `Dynamic analysis: What registry value has the HopHelper.exe modified for persistence?`
