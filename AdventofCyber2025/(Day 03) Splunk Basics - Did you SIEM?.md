- Splunk: Data processing platform; parses logs into a readable format and allows fast query of logs
- log sources (source type)
      web_traffic: web connections to and from the web server 
      firewall_logs: shows if logged traffic was allowed or blocked
- histogram: spike in activity -> attack window
- fields:
      `#` - automatically extracted fields (generated by time commands) 
      `a` - manually added 

- User agent: indicates what software initiated the web request
- URI (unique resource identifier): can be used to access a resource on a web server(if manipulated)

- Firewall logs show if the attacker gained access, established a connection, etc.
- Directory traversal: ../../etc/passwd
- Automated SQLi tools: Havij, sqlmap

  
### Codes
- 504: Successful SQL injection
- 401, 403, 404: unauthorized response, forbidden, page not found
