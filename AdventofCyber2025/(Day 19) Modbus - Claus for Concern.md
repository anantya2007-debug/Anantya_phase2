- SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) -> Command centre for industrial operations; bridge human operators and physical machines
- PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) -> brains of automation; read sensor input, execute logic rules, and send commands to actuators
- SCADA systems are attractive targets because:
     1. They often run legacy software
     2. Default credentials are rarely changed
     3. Designed for reliability, not security
     4. Control physical processes (real-world impact)
     5. Commonly connected to corporate networks
     6. Use insecure protocols like Modbus

- Modbus -> old industrial communication protocol
