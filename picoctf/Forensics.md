Decode this message from the moon.

## Solution
From the hint "How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth?", I was able to find that the pictures from the moon landing were sent in the form of SSTV (slow-scan television) transmissions. 

Using an online SSTV decoder [https://sstv-decoder.mathieurenaud.fr/](url), I was able to get an image from the provided wav file.
