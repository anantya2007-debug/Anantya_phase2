# 1. IQ Test

let your input x = 30478191278.

wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.

As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution

First, I converted the input x = 30478191278 into binary by dividing by 2. 
I got x = 011100011000101001000100101010101110 in the case of 36 digits. 

I then replaced the values of x0, x1, x2, ..., x35 with the digits of binary x (starting from the MSB) and got the following output.

THe flag is in the form of ```nite{}``` and the values of y0, y1..., y11 inside the brackets. 

## Flag:
```
nite{100010011000}
```

## Notes:
In order to figure out if the values of x0, x1..., x35, started from MSB or the LSB, I used the example question to match the flag given to the values of ```y``` that I was getting.
