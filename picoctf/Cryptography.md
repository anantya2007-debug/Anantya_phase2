# 1. rsa_oracle 

Can you abuse the oracle?
An attacker was able to intercept communications between a bank and a fintech company. They managed to get the message (ciphertext) and the password that was used to encrypt the message.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

After some intensive reconnaissance, they found out that the bank has an oracle that was used to encrypt the password and can be found here ```nc titan.picoctf.net 61563```. Decrypt the password and use it to decrypt the message. The oracle can decrypt anything except the password.

# 2. Custom encryption

Can you get a sense of this code file and write the function that will decode the given encrypted file content.
Find the encrypted file here flag_info and code file might be good to analyze and get the flag.

## Solution

By analyzing the given encrytion code i tried reversing what had been done to decrypt the code. 
The encryption consisted of 
1. Shared lock (Diffie-Hellman formula)
2. A multiplication lock
3. XOR + reversal lock

### Shared lock (Diffie-Hellman formula)
This is essentially creating two keys for a and b in such a way that they open the same lock (i.e. Diffie-Hellman formula)
Here, by using the public numbers ```g``` and ```p```, the private numbers ```a``` and ```b``` are connected to make a secret common key which in this case is 83.
